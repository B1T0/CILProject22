## Neural Collaborative Filtering
The Code of NFC-models is in the [NCF-folder](https://github.com/B1T0/CILProject22/tree/main/NFC). By running the script run.py the model will be built as specified in model.py, and trained on the 5-fold split. In the prediction phase it saves 5 predictions.csv files in the [data-folder](https://github.com/B1T0/CILProject22/tree/main/data), one for each trained model. Afterwards the predictions will be averaged into one ensemble prediciton. The hyperparameters are the ones we used in our final predictions and are the one we found by doing hyperparameter tuning.
