## Neural Collaborative Filtering
The Code of NFC-models is in the [NCF-folder](https://github.com/B1T0/CILProject22/tree/main/NFC). By running the script run.py the model will be built as specified in model.py, train it on the 5-fold split and return 5 predictions in the [data-folder](https://github.com/B1T0/CILProject22/tree/main/data), one for each trained model. Afterwards the predictions will be averaged into one ensemble prediciton. The hyperparameters are the ones we used in our final predictions are doing hyperparameter tuning.
